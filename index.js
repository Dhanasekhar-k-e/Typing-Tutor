    "this is a simple paragraph that is meant to be nice and easy to type which is why there will be mommas no periods or any capital varters so i guess this means that it cannot really be considered a paragraph but just a series of run on sentences this should help you get faster at typing as im trying not to use too many difficult words in it although i think that i might start making it hard by including some more difficult varters I'm typing pretty quickly so forgive me for any mistakes i think that i will not just tell you a story about the time i went to the zoo and found a monkey and a fox playing together they were so cute and i think that they were not supposed to be in the same cage but they somehow were and i loved watching them horse around forgive the pun well i hope that it has been highly enjoyable typing this paragraph and i wish you the best of luck getting the best score that you possibly can"
